# Cervical Cancer Epidemiology: ML Insights into Risk Factors

This repository contains a data science and epidemiological analysis project focused on identifying key factors contributing to cervical cancer incidence using machine learning models.

## Project Summary

Cervical cancer remains a major global health challenge. This project explores the relationship between cervical cancer and four major risk factors: Hormonal Contraceptives, IUD Usage, Age, and Smoking.

### Objectives

- Understand the impact of selected factors on cervical cancer incidence.
- Clean and preprocess epidemiological data from Kaggle.
- Train and evaluate multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree).
- Visualize patterns and correlations.

### Research Question

How do hormonal contraceptives, IUD usage, age, and smoking contribute to the epidemiology of cervical cancer?

## Repository Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Cervical_Cancer_Epidemiology_Report.pdf` | Comprehensive project report including background, methods, statistical results, and conclusions |
| `Cervical_Cancer_Epidemiology_Presentation.pptx` | Summary slide deck with key visuals and model results |
| `notebooks/` (to be added) | Jupyter/Python notebooks for data cleaning, EDA, model building |
| `data/` (to be added) | CSV or Excel dataset (sourced from Kaggle) |

## Key Techniques

- Data Cleaning: Handling null values, encoding categorical data, removing outliers
- Statistical Analysis: Chi-square test, correlation heatmaps
- Machine Learning:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
- Evaluation Metrics: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Accuracy Score, Cross-validation

## Results

| Model              | Accuracy |
|-------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 96%     |
| SVM                | 97%     |
| Random Forest      | 94%     |
| Decision Tree      | 94%     |

Despite high accuracy, the p-value was greater than 0.05, leading to acceptance of the null hypothesisâ€”no statistically significant relationship was established.
